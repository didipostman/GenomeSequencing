Abstract

Here I share with you my IT model for DNA damage repair and Genome Sequencing Solution. It
can be used to fight covid19 or any other disease, or as a genetic framework like
Crispr cas9 or to figure out a vaccine or medicines.

The Model
Since 2012 I tried a theory an IT model for DNA damage repair and genome sequencing solution
based on an open source framework java which is Spring Batch + an algorithm of DNA pattern
recognition.I did a template project to more explain
here You will find a fully présentation of it. You just have to read the readme file and explore the source code I used a template code of *
@author bruce.liu(mailto:jxta.liu@gmail.com) Very special thanks to him. The source code
template is in Github under MIT licence.

I thaugt even to go further to read all the human DNA by using Spring batch integration and using GridGain.

I think only one instance of Spring Batch + an algorithm of DNA pattern recognition may be the
solution to create a virus, a drugs or genetic framework like Crispr Cas 9 based on that architecture
It could help against covid 19 as we know RNA responsible of it.

As I told you before it is only the concept a simple sample, an idea in my point of view worth to be
considered a hard work remains to be done.

I cant go further with it may be someone find it useful and continue.

Conclusion
The model can be embeded in nano Robots and you can cure illnesses and viruses you know RNA /
DNA like covid 19.
